When maintaining a calendar of events, it is important to know if an event overlaps with another event.
Given a sequence of events, each having a start and end time, this is a Clojure program that will return the sequence of all pairs of overlapping events.

## Usage

To run the demo

    lein run

To run test

    lein test

TODO:
 1) Find a better way rather than converting to DateTime
 2) When doing test, Clojure spec should be used to generate input.
